# How to deposit into FLUX

Getting FLUX is simple - just send USDC to the bot address and receive FLUX tokens automatically.

## Prerequisites

Before depositing, make sure you have:
- USDC on Base network
- A small amount of ETH for gas fees

## Deposit Address

Send USDC on Base to:
```
0x9EE4d24dB1104bDF818391efCB8CCBa8Ff206159
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open Your Wallet

Open your Web3 wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) and ensure you're on Base network.

**Important:** Use a real wallet, NOT an exchange address. Exchanges won't credit FLUX tokens to your account.

### 2. Send USDC

Send your desired amount of USDC to the bot address above. 

**Important:** 
- Minimum deposit is 10 USDC
- Only send USDC on Base network
- Double-check the address before sending
- Must send from a wallet you control (NOT from an exchange)

### 3. Receive FLUX

Once your transaction confirms, FLUX tokens will automatically be sent to your wallet. The amount you receive is based on the current portfolio value.

### 4. Add FLUX to Your Wallet

To see your FLUX tokens, add the custom token:

**Token Address:** `0xB6a9D1E420B0DbAa3d137D8aa3D97927f04eA8F9`  
**Symbol:** FLUX  
**Decimals:** 6

## How Pricing Works

The amount of FLUX you receive is calculated as:
```
FLUX Received = (USDC Sent Ã— 0.99) / Current FLUX Price
```

The 1% fee supports protocol operations.
