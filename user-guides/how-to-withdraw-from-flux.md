# How to withdraw from FLUX

Withdrawing is simple - just send FLUX tokens to the bot address and receive USDC automatically.

## Withdrawal Address

Send FLUX tokens to:
```
0x9EE4d24dB1104bDF818391efCB8CCBa8Ff206159
```

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Open Your Wallet

Open your Web3 wallet and ensure you're on Base network.

**Important:** You must use the same wallet that holds your FLUX tokens. Never try to send FLUX from an exchange.

### 2. Send FLUX

Send the amount of FLUX you want to redeem to the bot address above.

**Important:**
- Only send FLUX tokens, not any other token
- Ensure you're on Base network
- Have ETH for gas fees
- Must send from your own wallet (NOT from an exchange)

### 3. Receive USDC

Once your transaction confirms, USDC will automatically be sent to your wallet. The amount you receive is based on the current portfolio value.

## How Pricing Works

The amount of USDC you receive is calculated as:
```
USDC Received = (FLUX Sent × Current FLUX Price) × 0.99
```

The 1% fee helps protect long-term holders from arbitrage.

## Partial Withdrawals

You don't need to withdraw all your FLUX at once. Send any amount you want to redeem.

## Current FLUX Price

Check the current FLUX price at [aquaflux.tech](https://aquaflux.tech) before withdrawing to see how much USDC you'll receive.

## Processing Time

Withdrawals are processed automatically as soon as your transaction confirms on Base (usually within 30 seconds).
