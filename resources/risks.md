# Risks

Like all DeFi protocols, FLUX carries inherent risks. Please understand these before investing.

## Smart Contract Risk

Smart contracts can have bugs or vulnerabilities that could result in loss of funds.

**Mitigation:**
- Verified contracts on BaseScan
- Using battle-tested protocols like Balancer
- Implementing security best practices
- Continuous monitoring and updates

## Market Risk

Token prices can be volatile, affecting portfolio value.

**What this means:**
- Your FLUX value in USD can fluctuate
- Market crashes can reduce portfolio value
- Recovery depends on market conditions

**Mitigation:**
- Diversification across multiple pools
- Automatic rebalancing based on market conditions
- Exposure to both stable and volatile assets

## Liquidity Risk

Large withdrawals might face liquidity constraints.

**What this means:**
- Very large redemptions may impact price
- Pool liquidity can vary
- Emergency exits might incur higher slippage

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple pool positions improve liquidity
- Monitoring of pool depths
- Gradual withdrawal options

## Impermanent Loss

Providing liquidity can result in impermanent loss versus holding tokens.

**What this means:**
- Pool positions may underperform simply holding tokens
- Losses become permanent when exiting positions
- More significant in volatile markets

**Mitigation:**
- Focusing on correlated asset pairs
- Earning fees and rewards to offset IL
- Strategic pool selection

## Protocol Risk

Balancer or other integrated protocols could face issues.

**What this means:**
- Balancer exploits could affect FLUX
- Protocol upgrades might cause disruptions
- Governance decisions could impact returns

**Mitigation:**
- Only using established protocols
- Monitoring protocol health
- Maintaining ability to migrate if needed

## Regulatory Risk

DeFi regulations are evolving and could impact operations.

**What this means:**
- New regulations might restrict access
- Tax treatment could change
- Compliance requirements might increase

**Mitigation:**
- Maintaining compliance readiness
- Transparent operations
- Decentralized architecture

## Technical Risk

Technical failures could temporarily impact access or operations.

**What this means:**
- Website might be temporarily unavailable
- RPC endpoints could go down
- Network congestion might delay transactions

**Mitigation:**
- Multiple RPC providers
- On-chain operations continue regardless
- Alternative access methods available

## Concentration Risk

Significant exposure to Base network and Balancer protocol.

**What this means:**
- Base network issues affect everything
- Balancer problems impact entire portfolio
- Limited geographic/protocol diversity

**Mitigation:**
- Base is secured by Ethereum
- Balancer is battle-tested
- Future multi-chain expansion possible

## No Insurance

FLUX does not currently have protocol insurance.

**What this means:**
- No compensation for losses from hacks
- No coverage for smart contract failures
- Users bear full risk of participation

**Recommendation:**
- Only invest what you can afford to lose
- Consider personal DeFi insurance
- Understand and accept the risks

## Oracle Risk

Price feeds could be manipulated or fail.

**What this means:**
- Incorrect prices could affect operations
- Oracle failures might pause functionality
- Manipulation could cause losses

**Mitigation:**
- Using Balancer's internal pricing
- Multiple price sources
- Sanity checks on all values

## Risk Disclosure

**IMPORTANT:** This is experimental technology. While we've taken extensive precautions, losses are possible. By using FLUX, you accept all risks. There are no guarantees of profit, and you could lose your entire investment.
