# Security

FLUX prioritizes security through multiple layers of protection and best practices.

## Smart Contract Security

### Battle-Tested Infrastructure
FLUX builds on established protocols with proven security records:
- Balancer V3 for pool management
- OpenZeppelin standards for token implementation
- Industry-standard safety patterns

### Access Controls
- No admin keys that can drain funds
- Time-locked operations for critical functions
- Multi-signature requirements for upgrades

### Automated Safeguards
- MEV protection with transaction cooldowns
- Daily deposit limits per address
- Blacklist for known malicious addresses
- Circuit breakers for extreme market conditions

## Operational Security

### Portfolio Protection
- Diversification across multiple pools
- Automatic rebalancing to manage risk
- Real-time monitoring of pool health
- Emergency withdrawal mechanisms

### Transparent Operations
- All transactions visible on-chain
- Real-time portfolio tracking
- Verifiable contract interactions
- Verified contracts on BaseScan

## User Security

### Best Practices
- Always verify you're on the correct website: aquaflux.tech
- Check for HTTPS and valid SSL certificate
- Never share your private keys or seed phrases
- Use hardware wallets for large amounts

### Avoiding Scams
- FLUX team will never DM you first
- Never send tokens to addresses claiming to be "support"
- Verify all addresses against our official documentation
- Report suspicious activity in our Telegram

## Risk Management

### Systematic Risks
- Smart contract bugs (mitigated through testing)
- Oracle manipulation (using multiple price sources)
- Flash loan attacks (protected by cooldowns)
- Governance attacks (no governance tokens)

### Market Risks
- Impermanent loss in pools
- Token price volatility
- Liquidity crunches
- Black swan events

## Incident Response

### Emergency Procedures
If a security issue is detected:
1. Circuit breakers automatically activate
2. Rebalancing pauses to prevent losses
3. Team investigates and responds
4. Users are notified via official channels

### Reporting Security Issues
Found a vulnerability? Please report it responsibly:
- Telegram: Contact admin directly
- Email: Contact through Telegram for security email

## Audits and Reviews

### Code Reviews
- Internal review by experienced developers
- Professional security audits
- Continuous monitoring and testing

### Dependencies
All external dependencies are:
- Carefully vetted before integration
- Regularly updated for security patches
- Monitored for vulnerabilities

## Insurance

Currently, FLUX does not have protocol insurance. Users should:
- Only invest what they can afford to lose
- Consider personal DeFi insurance options
- Understand all risks before depositing

## Continuous Improvement

Security is an ongoing process. We:
- Monitor for new attack vectors
- Implement additional safeguards as needed
- Learn from incidents across DeFi
- Engage with security researchers
