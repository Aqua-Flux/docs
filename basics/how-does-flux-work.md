# How does FLUX work?

FLUX operates as a share-based investment system, similar to traditional index funds but for DeFi.

## The Investment Flow

1. **You deposit USDC** into the FLUX protocol
2. **You receive FLUX tokens** representing your share of the portfolio
3. **The protocol invests** your USDC across handpicked Balancer pools
4. **Yields accumulate** from trading fees and rewards
5. **Value grows** as returns are automatically reinvested

## Portfolio Management

FLUX uses an intelligent system that:

**Selects Pools**  
Identifies high-performing Balancer pools with attractive risk-reward profiles.

**Manages Allocations**  
Distributes funds across multiple pools to balance risk and maximize returns.

**Monitors Performance**  
Tracks pool yields and market conditions continuously.

**Adapts Intelligently**  
The smart portfolio manager adjusts positions based on market conditions and opportunities.

**Compounds Daily**  
Claims and reinvests rewards to accelerate growth.

## The Share Model

FLUX tokens work like shares in a fund:

- Each token represents an equal share of the total portfolio
- As the portfolio grows, each token becomes more valuable
- The price reflects the real-time value of underlying assets
- You can buy or sell tokens at any time based on current value

## Market Adaptation

The protocol adapts to market conditions:

**Growth Periods**  
Increases exposure to opportunities when market sentiment is positive.

**Uncertain Markets**  
Maintains balanced allocations to weather volatility.

**Defensive Periods**  
Shifts to more stable positions during market downturns.

## Transparency

Everything FLUX does is:

- **On-chain** - All transactions are public and verifiable
- **Transparent** - Verified contracts on BaseScan
- **Real-time** - Portfolio value updates continuously
- **Auditable** - Anyone can verify holdings and performance
