# Why should I use FLUX?

Are you tired of constantly searching for the best yields in DeFi? Frustrated by the complexity of managing multiple positions across different protocols? Worried about missing out on rewards or getting caught in poorly performing pools?

FLUX eliminates these pain points by automatically seeking and investing in high-yield opportunities for you.

## The Problem with Manual DeFi

Managing DeFi positions manually is exhausting, time-consuming, and expensive. You need to:

- Research dozens of pools to find good yields
- Monitor positions constantly for changes in APR
- Claim rewards regularly before they're diluted
- Pay gas fees for every transaction
- Rebalance when market conditions change
- Track everything for tax purposes

Most people simply don't have the time or expertise to do this effectively.
